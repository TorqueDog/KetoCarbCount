# KetoCarbCount
The Keto 'Net-Carb Count' document!

This repo will serve as a revival of the 'Net-Carb Count' document that was on Reddit's [/r/Keto](https://old.reddit.com/r/keto) subreddit, previously hosted on Google Sheets.

Some time ago, the original Google account hosting the list deleted the file, and -- since then -- the community has not found a replacement... but thanks to the magic of Internet caching, the file is back!

Here's what's available in this repo:
|Document|Description|
|:---|:---|
|&bull; [Online Net Carb Count list for Ketoers](KetoNetCarbCountList.md)|A quick reference of Net Carb Counts and some keto dining advice, hosted on GitHub.|
|&bull; [Net Carb Count list for Ketoers Excel](KetoNetCarbCountList.xlsx)|A downloadable version of the Net Carb Counts list in Microsoft Excel .XLSX format.|
|&bull; [Archived version of the original Net Carb Count list from Google Sheets](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/TorqueDog/KetoCarbCount/blob/3962235f744256956665526b68b6194f2bbd98d7/ArchivedNetCarbCountSheet.html)|The Google Sheet that started it all, extracted using the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine.|
